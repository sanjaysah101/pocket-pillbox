Ultra-accessible. Fully self-contained. Built with zero dependencies.

I chose the following tracks and **fully satisfied all three**:

🛎️ About Notification Reminders

- When it’s time to take your medication, Pocket Pillbox will display a browser notification—
(as long as the app is open in a browser tab and notification permissions are granted).
- Notifications **are private**: they’re handled locally by your browser.
- Due to browser limitations and privacy, notifications work only while the page is open (background/browsing notifications aren’t supported in this version).

✅ High contrast theme  
✅ Large, readable UI with low cognitive load  
✅ Fully navigable with keyboard (Tab/Enter/Arrow keys)  
✅ ARIA labels and semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility
